## Phase 2: Database Layer Migration

### Issues Identified

#### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: PrismaClient Import Error**
**Phase**: Database Layer Migration
**File**: `libs/database/src/database.service.ts`
**Category**: CONFIGURATION ISSUE
**Priority**: HIGH

**Description**:
Initial PrismaClient import failed with "Module '@prisma/client' has no exported member 'PrismaClient'" error.

**Root Cause**:
The issue was caused by using a custom schema path (`libs/database/prisma/schema.prisma`) without proper client generation configuration. The default Prisma setup expects the schema to be in the root directory.

**Solution Applied**:
- Removed custom output path configuration from generator
- Used default Prisma client generation process
- Let Prisma handle the client location automatically with `pnpm db:generate --schema=libs/database/prisma/schema.prisma`

**Status**: RESOLVED - TypeScript compilation passes, build succeeds, application starts correctly
